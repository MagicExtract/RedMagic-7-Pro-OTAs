# RedMagic-7-Pro-OTAs

OTA Updates extracted for Nubia Red Magic 7 Pro (Model: NX709J)



   After doing a lot, and I mean A LOT... of searching I've found that there are absolutely zero sources for OTA zip files for the 7 Pro.
I figured I'd do some uploading of my own, this is for the global (North America and Asia) version, AKA UNCommon.

   Going through what I have just to be able to be on the latest software while still having root, I bring to you this collection of OTA's provided for this Model/Verison in specific.
If there are any requests please feel free to ask, If all is successful I'll probably be able to do the same with the European version on my free time.

   I'll try my best to go from the lowest version up to the latest if/when possible. 
I do understand that there are some out there who prefer older updates over new ones, so this one is especially for you buddy.

   I am also working on creating a TWRP recovery for this model as well, AND will be including a payload dumper in the repository with instructions on how to successfully extract your boot.img
As well as a flashing tutorial, so I guess this is gonna be an all in one repository(?)

  I dunno, we'll see.

  Anyways, thanks for stopping by stranger, hope this helps.

  Sincerely,

  Magic Extract.
